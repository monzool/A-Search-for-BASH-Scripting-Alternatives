# A Search for BASH Scripting Alternatives

This is my personal endeavor to find a shell scripting alternative that can replace bash


- [Take 1](https://github.com/monzool/A-Search-for-BASH-Scripting-Alternatives/blob/master/Take1/Take1.md) - In 2017 I found a large pool of scripting languages, and listed pro/cons for each language.

- [Take 2](https://github.com/monzool/A-Search-for-BASH-Scripting-Alternatives/blob/master/Take2/Take2.md) - In 2024 I narrowed the pool of alternatives and picked a handful of them to try out. A sample made in bash, is re-implemented in each of the candidate languages.
